# About us

Cloudboss has been automating cloud infrastructure for our clients since 2017.

At Cloudboss, we believe the best automation is the kind you never have to think about. No surprises, no sudden failures—just steady, reliable software that runs like clockwork.

We don’t chase hype or overcomplicate things. Instead, we focus on what matters: building automation that keeps your cloud stable, scalable, and secure. With our methods, the automation quietly handles the heavy lifting, so your team can spend less time firefighting and more time innovating.
