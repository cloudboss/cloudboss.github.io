At Cloudboss, security isn’t a checkbox, it’s baked into every step. We ensure that sensitive data remains protected in Secrets Manager, never in source code. IAM roles follow the principle of least privilege, granting only the necessary privileges to reduce the blast radius. Service Control Policies are applied across your organization to set permission limits across all AWS accounts. Security groups are configured to allow only essential network traffic, never left open to the world. With Cloudboss, your cloud environment stays secure, compliant, and built for resilience.
