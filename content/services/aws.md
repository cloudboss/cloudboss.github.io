We love all the major cloud providers, but at the end of the day, AWS is still the OG.

To paraphrase the old saying, “Nobody ever got fired for buying AWS.” When it comes to features, stability, and scalability, AWS often has the edge over the competition. But let’s be honest---the platform grows more complex every year.

Cloudboss has spent years honing our skills in AWS, allowing us to cut through the complexity and bring simplicity to your cloud automation. Whether you’re managing virtual machines, containers, or automating workflows, we make AWS work for you---while always keeping security and reliability in mind.

## Where We Excel in AWS

### EC2: Flexible, Scalable Compute

EC2, with its practically unlimited machines running Linux, is everything we love about the cloud.

We ensure autoscaling is enabled, not only for the cost savings but also to enable self healing and high availability. Combined with elastic load balancing, we'll make sure your application is always running---even during upgrades.

We'll build tailored AMIs ([Amazon Machine Images](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html)) to match your exact needs or create a pipeline so you can build them yourself from a template. We [pioneered](https://github.com/cloudboss/easyto) converting Docker images into AMIs so you can run EC2 instances almost like containers.

### AWS Organizations: Multi-Account Management Simplified

We can establish governance at scale with AWS Control Tower and create a secure, standardized Landing Zone. With AWS Account Factory for Terraform, you'll be able to automate AWS account creation to ensure infrastructure consistency and giving you a control plane across your whole organization.

### ECS: Containers Without the Complexity of Kubernetes

If you want the benefits of container orchestration without a lot of operational overhead, ECS is an effective and simple choice. We can set up your application pipeline to deploy onto ECS so you can focus on building, not troubleshooting.

### EKS: Embracing the Complexity of Kubernetes

While we love the simplicity of ECS, we know Kubernetes remains a popular choice. But don't wait for Amazon's forced cluster upgrades to cause a midnight outage---let us help you manage your clusters and keep your upgrades on track.

### Lambda: The Computing Swiss Army Knife

We'll write Lambda functions in Python, Go, or Rust to help you to "fill gaps" in AWS services, extend AWS functionality using CloudWatch Events (EventBridge), or combine with Step Functions to orchestrate complex workflows.

### Security: Always On

At Cloudboss, security isn’t a checkbox, it’s baked into every step. We ensure that sensitive data remains protected in Secrets Manager, never in source code. IAM roles follow the principle of least privilege, granting only the necessary privileges to reduce the blast radius. Service Control Policies are applied across your organization to set permission limits across all AWS accounts. Security groups are configured to allow only essential network traffic, never left open to the world. With Cloudboss, your cloud environment stays secure, compliant, and built for resilience.
